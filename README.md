# [INACTIVE] Events Calendar Event Organizer Email Extension
Send a custom email to an event organizer specified within the structure of the Events Calendar Pro plugin

As a failsafe, this plugin is set to send event organizer emails to the site admin by default. To change this go to WooCommerce >> Settings >> Email >> Event Organizer Email and select the first option under Recipient(s).
